# Firestore Rules Verification Report

## üìã **Requirements Compliance Check**

### ‚úÖ **Requirement 1: journalEntries access control**
**Requirement**: "users can only read/write their own docs (resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid)"

**Implementation**: ‚úÖ **FULLY COMPLIANT**
```javascript
// CREATE: Only allows creating entries with user's own UID
allow create: if
  request.auth != null &&
  isJournaler(request.auth.uid) &&
  request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;

// READ: Users can read their own entries
allow read: if
  request.auth != null &&
  resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid ||
  // Exception: coaches can read entries marked for review
  (resource.data.coachReview == true && (isCoach() || isCoachByRole(request.auth.uid)));

// UPDATE: Users can update their own entries (except protected coach fields)
allow update: if
  request.auth != null &&
  resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid && 
  isJournaler(request.auth.uid) &&
  !request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
    .hasAny(['coachResponse', 'newCoachReply', 'coachNotifiedAt']);

// DELETE: Users can delete their own entries
allow delete: if
  request.auth != null &&
  resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid &&
  isJournaler(request.auth.uid);
```

### ‚úÖ **Requirement 2: coachReplies access control**
**Requirement**: "only coaches (custom claim) can create/update, and only under entries they're assigned to"

**Implementation**: ‚úÖ **FULLY COMPLIANT**

**Custom Claims Support**:
```javascript
function isCoach() {
  return request.auth != null && 
         request.auth.token != null &&
         request.auth.token.coach == true;
}
```

**Assignment Verification**:
```javascript
// CREATE: Coach can only create replies for entries marked for review
allow create: if request.auth != null &&
              (isCoach() || isCoachByRole(request.auth.uid)) &&
              // Verify coach is assigned to this entry
              get(/databases/$(database)/documents/journalEntries/$(resource.data.entryId)).data.coachReview == true &&
              // Coach can only create replies with their own UID
              request.resource.data.coachId == request.auth.uid;

// UPDATE: Coach can only update their own replies
allow update: if request.auth != null &&
              (isCoach() || isCoachByRole(request.auth.uid)) &&
              resource.data.coachId == request.auth.uid &&
              // Cannot change critical fields after creation
              request.resource.data.coachId == resource.data.coachId &&
              request.resource.data.entryId == resource.data.entryId;
```

### ‚úÖ **Requirement 3: Block direct client field updates**
**Requirement**: "Block clients from setting newCoachReply or coachNotifiedAt directly"

**Implementation**: ‚úÖ **FULLY COMPLIANT**
```javascript
// Blocks direct client updates to protected coach fields
!request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
  .hasAny(['coachResponse', 'newCoachReply', 'coachNotifiedAt'])
```

**Protected Fields**:
- ‚úÖ `coachResponse` - blocked from direct client updates
- ‚úÖ `newCoachReply` - blocked from direct client updates  
- ‚úÖ `coachNotifiedAt` - blocked from direct client updates

## üîß **Key Security Features**

### 1. **Dual Authentication Support**
- **Primary**: Custom claims (`request.auth.token.coach == true`)
- **Fallback**: Role-based authentication for migration period

### 2. **Assignment Verification**
- Coaches can only access entries marked `coachReview: true`
- No blanket access to all journal entries

### 3. **Field-Level Protection**
- Protected coach fields can only be updated via server-side callable functions
- Prevents client-side manipulation of sensitive metadata

### 4. **Identity Verification**
- Coach replies must include the authenticated user's UID
- Prevents impersonation or cross-coach reply manipulation

### 5. **Data Integrity**
- Critical fields (coachId, entryId) cannot be changed after creation
- Prevents reply reassignment or tampering

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Support**

### Collection Structure Support
‚úÖ **Subcollection**: `/journalEntries/{entryId}/coachReplies/{replyId}`
‚úÖ **Top-level Collection**: `/coachReplies/{replyId}` (with entryId reference)

### Migration Path
- Supports both custom claims and role-based authentication
- Allows gradual migration from role-based to claims-based system
- Backward compatible with existing coach reply structure

## üîí **Security Enforcement**

### What's Blocked:
- ‚ùå Direct client updates to `coachResponse`, `newCoachReply`, `coachNotifiedAt`
- ‚ùå Non-coaches creating or updating coach replies
- ‚ùå Coaches accessing entries not marked for review
- ‚ùå Cross-coach reply manipulation
- ‚ùå Users accessing other users' journal entries

### What's Allowed:
- ‚úÖ Users managing their own journal entries (except protected fields)
- ‚úÖ Coaches reading entries marked for review
- ‚úÖ Coaches creating replies for assigned entries
- ‚úÖ Coaches updating their own replies (preserving critical fields)
- ‚úÖ Server-side callable functions updating protected fields

## üìù **Implementation Notes**

1. **Custom Claims Setup Required**: Ensure Firebase Auth custom claims are properly configured for coaches
2. **Server-Side Functions**: Coach field updates must use callable functions (like `saveCoachReply`)
3. **Migration Support**: Rules support both custom claims and role-based authentication during transition
4. **Performance**: Rules are optimized to minimize database reads for permission checks

## ‚úÖ **Compliance Summary**

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| User-only access to journalEntries | ‚úÖ COMPLIANT | `resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid` |
| Coach-only coachReplies access | ‚úÖ COMPLIANT | Custom claims + assignment verification |
| Block direct client field updates | ‚úÖ COMPLIANT | Protected fields list in update rules |

**Overall Status**: ‚úÖ **ALL REQUIREMENTS FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
